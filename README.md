Final project for Harvard edx's cs50 course. Webapp for budgeting and keeping
track of available spending money.

Disclaimer:
This code is a nightmare and I wouldn't wish having to look at it on anyone. It
is littered with poor design choices and in a completely unreadable and
untestable state. The entire thing needs some amount of refactoring. Most of it
needs major refactoring or a complete redesign. I made it public mostly for
posterity, but also to illustrate my improvements since writing it.
